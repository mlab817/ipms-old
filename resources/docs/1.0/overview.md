## I. General Features

The IPM System is hosted on Z.com Philippines (www.z.com). The system can be run in any browser but for best results, users are encouraged to use Google Chrome. It uses Laravel, a PHP-based open-source web application framework, with expressive, elegant syntax (visit www.laravel.com for more information).

## II. Security Features

Only authorized users will be able to access the system through the email and password provided by the IPD. Note that only users duly-endorsed by their OU heads will be given access. Audit logs, which contain electronic record of transactions/interactions in the system, will be generated by the system to ensure accountability on information encoded in the system.

One user account can be used simultaneously by different users in order to track records and ensure accuracy of information encoded in the system. Google login can also be used by users already registered in the System.
