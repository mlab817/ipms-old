## About the System

The Investment Programming and Management (IPM) System is an online database system that manages data entry and updates on priority program and projects (PAPs) under the Public Investment Program (PIP), which includes the PIPâ€™s Core Investment Programs and Projects (CIPs), non-CIPs, and Three-Year Rolling Infrastructure Program (TRIP), as well as the generation of PIP/CIP/TRIP-related reports.

The system is designed to: (i) allow online submission by DA operating units (OUs) of information regarding their priority PAPs, including project details and status updates; (ii) allow the IPD to review and validate OU submissions; and (iii) assist the IPD in generating reports.

OUs shall be guided by the DA Memorandum on the call for the submission of PAPs in the Updated 2017-2022 PIP as input to the annual plan and budget preparation.

The enhancement of the IPM System Version 2.0 was based on experience of the IPD during the PIP/TRIP Updating for FY 2022 budget preparation. Major enhancements in the System include a major rewrite of the IPMS code, enhanced system security (with roles and granular permissions), bug fixes, and additional data fields from PIPOL System.

Although this may be seen as a downgrade, the IPD has decided to remove the Program Module which was previously used to add activities and subprojects to the System. Consolidators will now be provided templates to facilitate their outside-the-IPMS consolidation and review which they can later on attach to support their Program/Project level submissions. The attachment will serve as the reference for validating whether Tier 2 activity-levels have been included in the PIP/TRIP.

## General Process, User Administration and Management

1. DA OUs with independent budgets for inclusion in the PIP and/or TRIP encodes PAPs through the System (Encoders).
1. The IPD validates OU submission (Reviewers). The PDS and SPCMAD can be tapped to validate OU submissions through the Assign Projects feature.
1. The IPD also serves as the administrator of the IPM System and overall coordinator for PIP and TRIP-related concerns (Administrator).
