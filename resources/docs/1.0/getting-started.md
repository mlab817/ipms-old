## 1. User Sign Up

The System does not support Sign up or Registration Flow. Users can only be added by the IPMS Admin. Once their 
account is created, users will receive an email notification containing their credentials
to use in accessing the IPMS v2. An example email can be seen below:

![Sample Email](/images/screenshots/sample-email.png)

> {danger} If you did not receive an email like this, check the `SPAM` folder of your email. 
> Also make sure that you have provided the correct email to the admin.

## 2. Log in to the System

A. To access the IPM System Version 2.0, open the web browser and type https://ipms-v2.dapmsipd.org in the address bar.
If you see the screen below, follow the instructions below it to proceed.

1. Click Advanced. 
2. Click “Proceed to ipms-v2.dapmsipd.org (unsafe)”.

If you do this, the site will proceed to the next screen. This happens if the browser detects that a website is using 
a self-signed certificate. For security reasons, refrain from inputting your personal information on these websites. 
If you are not sure, please contact IPD at ipd@da.gov.ph.

> {danger} Caution: Only do this to websites that you trust as other websites may pose as legitimate websites, when actually, they are not.

B. The system will then direct you to the `Login Page`. The login page will appear as shown in the figure below. 
Enter your registered email and password as designated PIP/TRIP Focal, and click the Sign in button.

If the email registered in the IPMS is Google / GMAIL, the user may also click the Sign in using Google+ which will show the screen below.

If you used a valid Gmail account, you will be directed to the Dashboard, otherwise, you will be returned to the Login page with an error.

> {info} Note: On their first login, users will be asked to change their password as the auto generated password may not be secure 
(e.g. if the email being used is used by others).

C. Upon successful login, the user will be directed to the Dashboard. Posted in the Dashboard are information for the 
user’s reference such as the quick statistics on the number of entries in the IPM System, and latest projects added, among others.

D. Select the operation to be performed by choosing among the modules in the Sidebar. The modules available in the Sidebar vary 
depending on the type of the user (i.e., Encoder, Reviewer, and Admin) accessing the System.
