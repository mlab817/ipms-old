## About IPMS

The Investment Programming and Management System (or simply IPMS) is a 
web application built using the PHP Laravel Framework (v.8.*). 
We believe that Public Investment Programming (PIP) formulation and updating
should focus on identification and prioritization of programs and projects
rather than merely encoding entries into a collection system (be it MS 
Excel, Google Sheets or any other platform). The IPMS is built as RESTful API
to make development more flexible and easy to build on.

The objectives of the IPMS are as follows:

1. To be a one-stop shop for all programs and projects to be submitted to the NEDA PIPOL System;
2. To build a bridge from the plan (or the AFMP/NAFMIP) to the budget (annual plan and budget);
3. To provide a list of potential projects for official development assistance financing;
4. To monitor the progress of implementation of programs and projects supportive to achieving 
   the goals of the Philippine agriculture and fisheries sector.
